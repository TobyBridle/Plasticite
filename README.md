## Description
Plasticite is a game developed for Games2Cation, a company focused
on creating fun, yet educational, games for young children.
Modelled around the idea of dangerous plastics
in our water supply, plasticite aims to be a fun way to raise awareness,
especially among younger generations.

The game is a simple 2D wave-based shooter, where the player must
destroy all of the plastics coming from the polluted water source
before they reach the player. The player can move around the screen
and shoot at the plastics, and the plastics will move towards the
player. The player can also upgrade their stats between
waves, and the game will get progressively harder as the player
advances.

The game is written in C# using the Unity game engine.

## How to Play
There is currently only one pre-built version of the game, which is
for Windows. To play the game, simply download the zip file from
the releases page, extract it, and run the executable.

For those who wish to build the game **from source**, you will need
to have Unity installed. You can download Unity from
[here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). Once you have Unity
installed, you can clone this repository and open the project in
Unity. From there, you can build the game for your platform of
choice.
